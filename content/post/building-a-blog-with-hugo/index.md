# Building a blog is easy with the right tools

As I was looking for a static site generator which supports `Markdown` as an input, I came across [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo is an open source static site generator written in `Go`. Hugo supports a lot of built in [Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/). One easy Theme to get started is [](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack-starter) from [CaiJimmy](https://github.com/CaiJimmy).
